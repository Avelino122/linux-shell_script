This repository contains my personal shell configurations and scripts for a more efficient and enjoyable CLI experience on my Ubuntu MATE setup. 

## Setup Overview
I've tailored my Linux environment to leverage the powerful and flexible Z shell (zsh) with the following enhancements:

- **Oh My Zsh (OMZ):** A delightful community-driven framework for managing my zsh configuration. It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shout "Oh My ZSH!" 
  - [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

- **Zinit:** A flexible and fast Zsh plugin manager that allows me to load plugins and themes without compromising on speed.
  - [Zinit GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit)

- **Spaceship Prompt:** A Zsh theme for Astronauts. It combines everything I need to work in the terminal and does it in a beautiful and minimalistic way.
  - [Spaceship Prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt)

- **Auto-suggestions & Syntax Highlighting Plugins:** These plugins provide real-time suggestions as I type, based on command history, and highlight the commands to improve readability and reduce the chance of errors.
